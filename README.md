# 📧 Phishing Email Analysis - Cyber Security Internship

## 📝 Task Overview
This task involved analyzing a sample phishing email to identify common phishing characteristics, including spoofed sender addresses, suspicious links, and social engineering tactics.

## 📂 Files Included
- `Screenshot (1).png`: Screenshot of the phishing email sample.
- `report.md` / `report.pdf`: A written analysis detailing phishing indicators found in the email.

## 🔍 Phishing Indicators Identified
1. **Spoofed Sender Email:** 
   - `desktop-support@securesupportcloud[.]com` is suspicious and not from a verified domain.
2. **Urgent Language:** 
   - Urges the user to “change your password by the end of the day,” a classic phishing tactic.
3. **Suspicious Link:** 
   - The "password reset link" is not transparent, and may redirect to a malicious site.
4. **Generic Greeting:** 
   - Uses "Hi Team" instead of a personalized salutation.
5. **Social Engineering:** 
   - Mentions a fabricated security incident to create fear and urgency.
6. **Unverifiable IT Team:** 
   - The sender signs off as "Contoso Corp IT Team," which is a well-known demo name, not a real organization.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Screenshot tool (Windows Snipping Tool)
- Email analysis based on provided phishing characteristics
- GitHub for documentation

## 🎯 Objective
To develop awareness of phishing tactics, learn how to inspect suspicious emails, and recognize red flags in real-world email communications.

## ✅ Outcome
This exercise improved my ability to analyze emails critically, recognize phishing attempts, and document findings in a professional format.
